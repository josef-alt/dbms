This repository will probably be empty for a while, I might just make it private.\
\
Databases have long been an interest of mine, so I intend to try to make a basic form of SQLite. I haven't really decided on any of the details, such as language.\
\
This is probably going to be a slow burning project that is front loaded with a lot of preliminary research - leaving this repository rather inactive.
